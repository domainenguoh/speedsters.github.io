      <p>
          Welcome to our research - the Data Schema Complexity Analysis. In this study, we explore the intricate relationship between a project's database schema complexity and its GitHub activity. Our working hypothesis suggests that as the complexity of the database schema increases, there's a corresponding augmentation in the number of commits and issues on GitHub. This correlation offers valuable insights into the challenges and maintenance efforts linked to managing such projects.

      <h2>DBDiagram.io: Visualizing and Analyzing Database Schemas</h2>

        <h3>Tool Explanation:</h3>
        <p>
          DBDiagram.io is a powerful and intuitive database design tool. It offers the capability to transform textual database schema definitions into clear, visually engaging diagrams that represent the intricate structure and relationships within a database. With its user-friendly interface, DBDiagram.io facilitates the visualization of complex database designs, making it an invaluable tool for researchers and developers alike.
        </p>
        <h3>Utilization in Our Solution:</h3>
        <p>
          DBDiagram.io played a pivotal role in our research process by providing a visual representation of the database schemas within the repositories. With the help of Selenium automation, we seamlessly uploaded the DBML files, which contain the schema definitions, to DBDiagram.io. This step not only enabled us to visualize the complexities of the database structures but also set the stage for further analysis. The visual diagrams generated by DBDiagram.io formed the basis for our subsequent analysis using OpenCV. Through DBDiagram.io, we gained a visual understanding of the intricate relationships and structures within the databases, enhancing our insights into the projects' complexities.

      <h2>Research Findings</h2>

        <p>
          Our hypothesis posited that an increase in database schema complexity would correspond to a rise in the number of commits and issues. These indicators signify elevated maintenance and potential project management difficulties. Our preliminary findings substantiate this hypothesis. This underscores the significance of meticulous database design in software development projects. Although a complex schema can offer heightened flexibility and robustness, it can also lead to escalated commits and issues, potentially impeding overall project efficiency.

    <section id="solution-process">
      <h2>Solution Process Overview</h2>

        <p><strong>GitHub API and Repository Discovery:</strong></p>
        <p>
          The research commences by utilizing the GitHub API to search repositories for specific file extensions, such as .dbml. This phase serves as the initial data collection step, identifying relevant projects for further analysis.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Data Collection and Storage:</strong></p>
        <p>
          Repositories identified through the GitHub API search are compiled and stored in a structured format, often a TXT file. This compilation acts as a central repository, facilitating easy access and reference for the duration of the research.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Data Extraction with Gitana:</strong></p>
        <p>
          Leveraging tools like Gitana, the research extracts essential information from repositories, such as commit histories, issue data, and user interactions. This extracted data forms the foundation for subsequent analysis and insights.
        </p>
        <p><strong>DBDiagram.io Visualization with Selenium:</strong></p>
        <p>
          DBDiagram.io is employed to visualize database schemas based on the extracted data. Automation tools like Selenium assist in streamlining the process by automating the uploading of data to the visualization platform.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Visual Analysis with OpenCV:</strong></p>
        <p>
          OpenCV is harnessed for visual analysis, evaluating images or diagrams generated by tools like DBDiagram.io. This analysis often involves assessing shapes, patterns, sizes, and other visual elements to derive insights.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Repository Complexity Analysis:</strong></p>
        <p>
          Further extraction of data using tools like Gitana is conducted to gain an in-depth understanding of repository activities. This includes details about commits, issues, and other interactions, contributing to the overall assessment.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Correlation and Graphical Analysis:</strong></p>
        <p>
          The research process synthesizes data from different sources, aiming to establish correlations and patterns. Graphical representations are employed to visualize these correlations, offering a visual summary of insights.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Insightful Documentation and Reporting:</strong></p>
        <p>
          The final phase involves documentation and reporting. The insights derived from the analysis, correlations, and visualizations are documented in comprehensive reports and presentations that communicate the research findings effectively.

      <div class="insight">
        <h3>Direct Correlation between Schema Complexity and Commits</h3>
        <p>As the complexity of the database schema (number of tables) increases, there seems to be a rise in the number of commits. This could be due to multiple reasons:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A complex schema might require more iterative development, leading to more commits.</li>
          <li>Changes in one part of a complex schema might necessitate changes in other parts, leading to multiple commits for a single logical change.</li>

        <h3>Issues and Schema Complexity</h3>
        <p>The relationship between the number of issues and schema complexity might be more nuanced. While it's logical to assume that a more complex schema could lead to more issues, the actual correlation might depend on factors like the experience of the development team, the clarity of requirements, and the thoroughness of testing.</p>

                  <strong>Selenium:</strong>
                  <u> Description:</u> Selenium is a robust tool for automating web browsers. This means that any task you can do manually on a browser, Selenium can automate it for you. <br>
                  <u>Use in Research:</u> Our research process involved uploading DBML files to DBDiagram.io, and extracting the schema model. Instead of doing this manually for every file, we automated this task using Selenium, saving significant time and ensuring accuracy.<br>                  <u>Website:</u> <a href="https://www.selenium.dev/">Selenium Official Site</a>
