      <h2>About the Project</h2>
      <p>
        Welcome to our fascinating research project! Here, we delve into the intriguing relationship between the complexity of a project's database schema and its GitHub activity.
        Our hypothesis is that as the complexity of the database schema increases, there will be a corresponding rise in the number of commits and issues on GitHub. This correlation can provide valuable insights into the challenges and maintenance efforts involved in managing such projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our research focuses on analyzing a diverse set of projects hosted on GitHub. By searching using GitHub API, extracting data using Gitana, visualizing database schemas with DBDiagram.io, and analyzing images with OpenCV, we strive to gain deeper insights into how schema design impacts project development and management.

      <h2>Research Workflow</h2>
      <p>
        To ensure the precision, accuracy, and comprehensiveness of our research, we've established a systematic and thorough workflow. This workflow guarantees that we obtain meaningful insights from the data while maintaining data integrity. The entire process can be divided into the following stages:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Initial Project Setup: Define the scope and objectives of the research. Identify and set up access to necessary tools and platforms.</li>
        <li>Repository Discovery: Employ the GitHub API to identify repositories containing .dbml files. This API search facilitates a comprehensive list of potential projects for study.</li>
        <li>Data Collection: Organize the resulting repository details in a structured TXT list, ensuring easy access and reference in later stages.</li>
        <li>Repository Cloning: Clone each identified repository locally. This allows in-depth analysis, ensuring no data point is missed.</li>
        <li>Data Extraction: Use Gitana, particularly focusing on Java and Python projects, to pull out commit histories, issues, user data, and other pertinent information from the cloned repositories.</li>
        <li>Database Management: Streamline and store the extracted data in a structured MySQL database. This design facilitates rapid data retrieval and complex analyses.</li>
        <li>DBML Analysis: Identify and extract the DBML files within each repository. These files are uploaded to DBDiagram.io for visualization.</li>
        <li>Automation: With the help of Selenium, automate the process of uploading DBML files to DBDiagram.io, followed by the extraction of the schema model. This ensures consistency, time-efficiency, and error minimization.</li>
        <li>Image Processing: Obtain the visual representations of the data schemas from DBDiagram.io and subject them to complexity analysis using OpenCV. Factors like shapes, sizes, and line counts offer insights into schema intricacy.</li>
        <li>Repository Complexity Analysis: Based on MySQL data, evaluate the complexity of repositories, considering metrics like number of commits, issues, and contributors.</li>
        <li>Final Analysis: Establish a definitive correlation between the complexities of data schemas and the associated repositories. Understand the implications of this correlation and draw meaningful conclusions.</li>
        <li>Documentation and Reporting: Consolidate the research findings, draft comprehensive reports, and prepare presentations to showcase the results.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Adhering to this meticulous workflow, our research offers a comprehensive view of the interplay between data schema complexity and GitHub repository activities, revealing patterns that can influence best practices in project development and management.
